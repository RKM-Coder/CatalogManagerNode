to start with node project create folder open terminal or command prompt and write the command
	npm init	---> it will ask for project name, version, author, license and other details

then install required node modules
	npm install <Module Name> (or) npm i <Module Name>
	
	some basic needed modules
		express
		mongoose
		body-parser
		cors
		uuid
		morgan
	
create a main js file (eg: server.js)

packages, modules and files need to know about:
	app ->	controller, model, routes will be there in this module
	config -> node configuration files for development and production environment
	package.json -> this file holds various metadata relevant to the project. 
					This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.
	package-lock.json -> this file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json.
	.env -> 

connecting with database:
	In models module we have one file called db.js in that we write connection to db.
	for that we have to import mongoose, and our db url we already have in config file.
	connect to db by the mongoose.connect() function. (For more info check refernece link).
	after conenction is successfull get the connection string and export to module.
	

creating data models:
	To create a data model we need to import mongoos and mongoose schema.
	example in /models/users/users.js 
	and we have to create a new schema with feilds.
	and create mongoose model with mongoose.model() function
	and we have to export the model to module.
